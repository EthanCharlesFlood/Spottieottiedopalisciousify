# PRODUCTION README

## [Spottieottiedopalisciousify](https://spottieottiedopalisciousify.herokuapp.com/)

A single page webapp clone of spotify, featuring playist CRUD operations and
a continuously playing audioplayer. Spottieottiedopalisciousify is built with Rails, React, and Redux
and provides you with the ability to play 10s of your favorite songs (that are by Outkast(and from their second or third album)).


## PLAY YOUR FAVORITE SONGS
An HTML5 audio player was implemented via React and Redux allowing users to play all of their favorite songs from Outkast's second and third albums.  Custom styled HTML components where used with various event listeners to add functionality such as next and previous songs, fastforward and rewind, play and pause.

Redux was used to provide song queueing capabilities, allowing users to queue albums or add individual songs to the queue.

## PLAYLIST CRUD

Users can create, destroy, edit their own playlists and follow and listen to playlists created by other users.  In a users profile they have access to all of their own playlists in addition to any other playlists they are currently following.
